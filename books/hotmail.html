<TD><FONT SIZE=2>Microsoft has decided to get the hots for Sun and is using Solaris to run its acclaimed Hotmail web-based e-mail service instead of NT.

<P>
 The software giant has attempted to exchange the Sun/Solaris
 infrastructure of Hotmail with NT since buying it in December 1997.
 However, the demands of supporting 10 million users reportedly proved too
 great for NT, and Solaris was reinstated.

<P>
 In a leaked report, sources close to Hotmail said: "... its whole mail
 server infrastructure is Solaris. NT couldn't handle it. On the web
 server, they're running MP Pentiums and Apache on FreeBSD. They're moving
 to Solaris for threads. The engineering team did its best to run NT - and
 failed. The issue's being escalated."

<P>
 Hotmail is running Apache's /1.2.1 web server which is not available for
 NT due to technical difficulties. A statement on Apache's website states:
 "The road to Windows NT has not been a pretty one. Several attempts have
 been made, both by Apache Group members and outside folks, but due to a
 lack of stability and a clear consensus on how to manage a true
 cross-platform development project, NT is not yet a standard platform
 supported by Apache."

<P>
 Microsoft is currently recruiting engineers for Hotmail, but NT
 specialists need not apply. Hotmail's website lists vacancies for an
 operations software engineer and a QA engineer - and the common
 requirement is for Unix experience.

<P>
 Judy Gibbons, director of the Microsoft Network, was unaware of the
 hardware behind Hotmail, but said: "We looked at all the on-line mail
 services and Hotmail was far and away the best. It has the most proven and
 scalable architecture."
