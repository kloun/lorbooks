<h3>1. Introduction</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a requirement that X client applications must be portable
across server implementations, with very different file systems, naming conventions, and
font libraries. However, font access requests, as defined by the X Window System Protocol,
neither specify server-independent conventions for font names nor provide adequate font
properties for logically describing typographic fonts.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; X clients must be able to dynamically determine the fonts available
on any given server so that understandable information can be presented to the user or so
that intelligent font fallbacks can be chosen. It is desirable for the most common queries
to be accomplished without the overhead of opening each font and inspecting font
properties, by means of simple requests. For example, if a user selected a Helvetica
typeface family, a client application should be able to query the server for all Helvetica
fonts and present only those setwidths, weights, slants, point sizes, and character sets
available for that family.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This document gives a standard logical font description (hereafter
referred to as XLFD) and the conventions to be used in the core protocol so that clients
can query and access screen type libraries in a consistent manner across all X servers. In
addition to completely specifying a given font by means of its the XLFD also provides for
a standard set of key that describe the font in more detail.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The XLFD provides an adequate set of typographic font properties,
such as CAP_HEIGHT, X_HEIGHT, and RELATIVE_SETWIDTH, for publishing and other applications
to do intelligent font matching or substitution when handling documents created on some
foreign server that use potentially unknown fonts. In addition, this information is
required by certain<br>
clients to position subscripts automatically and determine small capital heights,
recommended leading, word-space values, and so on.</p>

<h3>2. Requirements and Goals</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The XLFD meets the short-term and long-term goals to have a standard
logical font description that: 

<ul>
  <li>Provides unique, descriptive font names that support simple pattern matching</li>
  <li>Supports multiple font vendors, arbitrary character sets, and encodings</li>
  <li>Supports naming and instancing of scalable and polymorphic fonts</li>
  <li>Supports transformations and subsetting of fonts</li>
  <li>Is independent of X server and operating or file system implementations</li>
  <li>Supports arbitrarily complex font matching or substitution</li>
  <li>Is extensible</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.1. Provide Unique and Descriptive Font Names</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It should be possible to have font names that are long enough and
descriptive enough to have a reasonable probability of being unique without inventing a
new registration organization. Resolution and size-dependent font masters, multivendor
font libraries, and so on must be anticipated and handled by the font name alone.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The name itself should be structured to be amenable to simple
pattern matching and parsing, thus allowing X clients to restrict font queries to some
subset of all possible fonts in the server.</p>

<h3>2.2. Support Multiple Font Vendors and Character Sets</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The font name and properties should distinguish between fonts that
were supplied by different font vendors but that possibly share the same name. We
anticipate a highly competitive font market where users will be able to buy fonts from
many sources according to their particular requirements.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A number of font vendors deliver each font with all glyphs designed
for that font, where charset mappings are defined by encoding vectors. Some server
implementations may force these mappings to proprietary or standard charsets statically in
the font data. Others may desire to perform the mapping dynamically in the server.
Provisions must be made in the font name that allows a font request to specify or identify
specific charset mappings in server environments where multiple charsets are supported.</p>

<h3>2.3. Support Scalable and Polymorphic Fonts</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a font source can be scaled to an arbitrary size or varied in
other ways, it should be possible for an application to determine that fact from the font
name, and the application should be able to construct a font name for any specific
instance.</p>

<h3>2.4. Support Transformations and Subsetting of Fonts</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arbitrary two-dimensional linear transformations of fonts should be
able to be requested by applications. Since such transformed fonts may be used for special
effects requiring a few characters from each of many differently transformed fonts, it
should be possible to request only a few characters from a font for efficiency.</p>

<h3>2.5. Be Independent of X Server and Operating or File System Implementations</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; X client applications that require a particular font should be able
to use the descriptive name without knowledge of the file system or other repository in
use by the server. However, it should be possible for servers to translate a given font
name into a file name syntax that it knows how to deal with, without compromising the
uniqueness of the font name. This algorithm should be reversible (exactly how this
translation is done is implementation dependent).</p>

<h3>2.6. Support Arbitrarily Complex Font Matching and Substitution</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the font name, the XLFD should define a standard list
of descriptive font properties, with agreed-upon fallbacks for all fonts. This allows
client applications to derive font-specific formatting or display data and to perform font
matching or substitution when asked to handle potentially unknown fonts, as required.</p>

<h3>2.7. Be Extensible</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The XLFD must be extensible so that new and/or private descriptive
font properties can be added to conforming fonts without making existing X client or
server implementations obsolete.</p>

<h3>3. X Logical Font Description</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XLFD is divided into two basic components: the which gives all font
information needed to uniquely identify a font in X protocol requests (for example, and so
on) and a variable list of optional which describe a font in more detail.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The is used in font queries and is returned as data in certain X
protocol requests. It is also specified as the data value for the item in the X Consortium
Character Bitmap Distribution Format Standard (BDF V2.1).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The are supplied on a font-by-font basis and are returned as data in
certain X protocol requests as part of the data structure. The names and associated data
values for each of the may also appear as items of the STARTPROPERTIES ... ENDPROPERTIES
list in the BDF V2.1 specification.</p>

<h3>3.1. FontName</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each is logically composed of two strings: a prefix that is followed
by a The uses the ISO 8859-1 encoding. The is an x-registered-name (a name that has been
registered with the X Consortium) that identifies the registration authority that owns the
specified syntax and semantics.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All font names that conform to this specification are to use a
prefix, which is defined to be the string &quot;-&quot; (HYPHEN). All prefixes of the
form: +version-, where the specified version indicates some future XLFD specification, are
reserved by the X Consortium for future extensions to XLFD font names. If required,
extensions to the current XLFD font name shall be constructed by appending new fields to
the current structure, each delimited by the existing field delimiter. The availability of
other prefixes or fonts that support other registries is server implementation dependent.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the X protocol specification, the is required to be a string;
hence, numeric field values are represented in the name as string equivalents. All fields
are also defined as numeric property values are represented as signed or unsigned
integers, as appropriate.</p>

<h3>3.1.1. FontName Syntax</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The is a structured, parsable string (of type STRING8) whose
Backus-Naur Form syntax description is as follows:</p>

<p>rw(1.5i) lw(3.75i).<br>
T{ FontName ::= T} T{ XFontNameRegistry XFontNameSuffix | PrivFont-<br>
NameRegistry PrivFontNameSuffix T} T{ XFontNameRegistry ::= T} T{ XFN-<br>
Delim | XFNExtPrefix Version XFNDelim T} T{ XFontNameSuffix ::= T} T{<br>
FOUNDRY XFNDelim FAMILY_NAME XFNDelim WEIGHT_NAME XFNDelim SLANT XFNDe-<br>
lim SETWIDTH_NAME XFNDelim ADD_ STYLE_NAME XFNDelim PIXEL_SIZE XFNDelim<br>
POINT_SIZE XFNDelim RESOLUTION_X XFNDelim RESOLUTION_Y XFNDelim SPACING<br>
XFNDelim AVERAGE_WIDTH XFNDelim CHARSET_REGISTRY XFNDelim CHARSET_ENCOD-<br>
ING T} T{ Version ::= T} T{ STRING8 - the XLFD version that defines an<br>
extension to the font name syntax (for example, &quot;1.4&quot;) T} </p>

<p>XFNExtPrefix ::= OCTET - &quot;+&quot; (PLUS)</p>

<p>XFNDelim ::= OCTET - &quot;-&quot; (HYPHEN) T{ PrivFontNameRegistry ::= T} T{ STRING8 -
other than those strings reserved<br>
by XLFD T} </p>

<p>PrivFontNameSuffix ::= STRING8</p>

<p>Field values are constructed as strings of ISO 8859-1 graphic characters, excluding the
following:

<ul>
  <li>&quot;-&quot; (HYPHEN), the XLFD font name delimiter character</li>
  <li>&quot;?&quot; (QUESTION MARK) and &quot;*&quot; (ASTERISK), the X protocol font name
    wildcard characters</li>
  <li>&quot;,&quot; (COMMA), used by Xlib to separate XLFD font names in a font set.</li>
  <li>&quot;&quot;&quot; (QUOTATION MARK), used by some commercial products to quote a font
    name.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alphabetic case distinctions are allowed but are for human
readability concerns only. Conforming X servers will perform matching on font name query
or open requests independent of case. The entire font name string must have no more than
255 characters. It is recommended that clients construct font name query patterns by
explicitly including all field delimiters to avoid unexpected results. Note that SPACE is
a valid character of a field; for example, the string &quot;ITC Avant Garde Gothic&quot;
might be a FAMILY_NAME.</p>

<h3>3.1.2. FontName Field Definitions</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This section discusses the

<ul>
  <li>FOUNDRY field</li>
  <li>FAMILY_NAME field</li>
  <li>WEIGHT_NAME field</li>
  <li>SLANT field</li>
  <li>SETWIDTH_NAME field</li>
  <li>ADD_STYLE_NAME field</li>
  <li>PIXEL_SIZE field</li>
  <li>POINT_SIZE field</li>
  <li>RESOLUTION_X and RESOLUTION_Y fields</li>
  <li>SPACING field</li>
  <li>AVERAGE_WIDTH field</li>
  <li>CHARSET_REGISTRY and CHARSET_ENCODING fields</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.1.2.1. FOUNDRY Field</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FOUNDRY is an x-registered-name, the name or identifier of the
digital type foundry that digitized and supplied the font data, or if different, the
identifier of the organization that last modified the font shape or metric information.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason this distinction is necessary is that a given font design
may be licensed from one source (for example, ITC) but digitized and sold by any number of
different type suppliers. Each digital version of the original design, in general, will be
somewhat different in metrics and shape from the idealized original font data, because
each font foundry, for better or for worse, has its own standards and practices for
tweaking a typeface for a particular generation of output technologies or has its own
perception of market needs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is up to the type supplier to register with the X Consortium a
suitable name for this field according to the registration procedures defined by the
Consortium.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The X Consortium shall define procedures for registering foundry and
other names and shall maintain and publish, as part of its public distribution, a registry
of such registered names for use in XLFD font names and properties.</p>

<h3>3.1.2.2. FAMILY_NAME Field</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FAMILY_NAME is a string that identifies the range or family of
typeface designs that are all variations of one basic typographic style. This must be
spelled out in full, with words separated by spaces, as required. This name must be
human-understandable and suitable for presentation to a font user to identify the typeface
family.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is up to the type supplier to supply and maintain a suitable
string for this field and font property, to secure the proper legal title to a given name,
and to guard against the infringement of other's copyrights or trademarks. By convention,
FAMILY_NAME is not translated. FAMILY_NAME may include an indication of design ownership
if considered a valid part of the typeface family name.</p>

<p>The following are examples of FAMILY_NAME:

<ul>
  <li>Helvetica</li>
  <li>ITC Avant Garde Gothic</li>
  <li>Times</li>
  <li>Times Roman</li>
  <li>Bitstream Amerigo</li>
  <li>Stone</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.1.2.3. WEIGHT_NAME Field</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WEIGHT_NAME is a string that identifies the font's typographic
weight, that is, the nominal blackness of the font, according to the FOUNDRY's judgment.
This name must be human-understandable and suitable for presentation to a font user. The
value &quot;0&quot; is used to indicate a polymorphic font (see section 6).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The interpretation of this field is somewhat problematic because the
typographic judgment of weight has traditionally depended on the overall design of the
typeface family in question; that is, it is possible that the DemiBold weight of one font
could be almost equivalent in typographic feel to a Bold font from another family.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WEIGHT_NAME is captured as an arbitrary string because it is an
important part of a font's complete human-understandable name. However, it should not be
used for font matching or substitution. For this purpose, X client applications should use
the weight-related font properties (RELATIVE_WEIGHT and WEIGHT) that give the coded
relative weight and the calculated weight, respectively.</p>

<h3>3.1.2.4. SLANT Field</h3>

<p>SLANT is a code-string that indicates the overall posture of the typeface design used
in the font. The encoding is as follows:</p>

<p>lw(.5i) lw(1.25i) lw(3.5i). _<br>
Code English Translation Description<br>
_<br>
&quot;R&quot; Roman Upright design<br>
&quot;I&quot; Italic T{ Italic design, slanted<br>
clockwise from the vertical T} <br>
&quot;O&quot; Oblique T{ Obliqued upright design, slanted clockwise from the vertical T} <br>
&quot;RI&quot; Reverse Italic T{Italic design, slanted counterclockwise from the vertical
T}<br>
&quot;RO&quot; Reverse Oblique T{ Obliqued upright design, slanted counter clockwise from
the vertical T} <br>
&quot;OT&quot; Other Other numeric Polymorphic See section 6 on polymorphic font support.<br>
_<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SLANT codes are for programming convenience only and usually are
converted into their equivalent human-understandable form before being presented to a
user.</p>

<h3>3.1.2.5. SETWIDTH_NAME Field</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SETWIDTH_NAME is a string that gives the font's typographic
proportionate width, that is, the nominal width per horizontal unit of the font, according
to the FOUNDRY's judgment. The value &quot;0&quot; is used to indicate a polymorphic font
(see section 6).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As with WEIGHT_NAME, the interpretation of this field or font
property is somewhat problematic, because the designer's judgment of setwidth has
traditionally depended on the overall design of the typeface family in question. For
purposes of font matching or substitution, X client applications should either use the
RELATIVE_SETWIDTH font property that gives the relative coded proportionate width or
calculate the proportionate width.</p>

<p>The following are examples of SETWIDTH_NAME:

<ul>
  <li>Normal</li>
  <li>Condensed</li>
  <li>Narrow</li>
  <li>Double Wide</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.1.2.6. ADD_STYLE_NAME Field</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ADD_STYLE_NAME is a string that identifies additional typographic
style information that is not captured by other fields but is needed to identify the
particular font. The character &quot;[&quot; anywhere in the field is used to indicate a
polymorphic font (see section 6).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ADD_STYLE_NAME is not a typeface classification field and is only
used for uniqueness. Its use, as such, is not limited to typographic style distinctions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following are examples of ADD_STYLE_NAME:

<ul>
  <li>Serif</li>
  <li>Sans Serif</li>
  <li>Informal</li>
  <li>Decorated</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.1.2.7. PIXEL_SIZE Field</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PIXEL_SIZE gives the body size of the font at a particular
POINT_SIZE and RESOLUTION_Y. PIXEL_SIZE is either an integer-string or a string beginning
with &quot;[&quot;. A string beginning with &quot;[&quot; represents a matrix (see section
4). PIXEL_SIZE usually incorporates additional vertical spacing that is considered part of
the font design. (Note, however, that this value is not necessarily equivalent to the
height of the font bounding box.) Zero is used to indicate a scalable font (see section
5).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PIXEL_SIZE usually is used by X client applications that need to
query fonts according to device-dependent size, regardless of the point size or vertical
resolution for which the font was designed.</p>

<h3>3.1.2.8. POINT_SIZE Field</h3>

<p>POINT_SIZE gives the body size for which the font was designed.<br>
POINT_SIZE is either an integer-string or a string beginning with &quot;[&quot;.<br>
A string beginning with &quot;[&quot; represents a matrix (see section 4). This<br>
field usually incorporates additional vertical spacing that is consid-<br>
ered part of the font design. (Note, however, that POINT_SIZE is not<br>
necessarily equivalent to the height of the font bounding box.)<br>
POINT_SIZE is expressed in decipoints (where points are as defined in<br>
the X protocol or 72.27 points equal 1 inch). Zero is used to indicate<br>
a scalable font (see section 5).<br>
<br>
POINT_SIZE and RESOLUTION_Y are used by X clients to query fonts accord-<br>
ing to device-independent size to maintain constant text size on the<br>
display regardless of the PIXEL_SIZE used for the font.<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>3.1.2.9. RESOLUTION_X and RESOLUTION_Y Fields</p>

<p>RESOLUTION_X and RESOLUTION_Y are unsigned integer-strings that give the<br>
horizontal and vertical resolution, measured in pixels or dots per inch<br>
(dpi), for which the font was designed. Zero is used to indicate a<br>
scalable font (see section 5). Horizontal and vertical values are<br>
required because a separate bitmap font must be designed for displays<br>
with very different aspect ratios (for example, 1:1, 4:3, 2:1, and so<br>
on).<br>
<br>
The separation of pixel or point size and resolution is necessary<br>
because X allows for servers with very different video characteristics<br>
(for example, horizontal and vertical resolution, screen and pixel size,<br>
pixel shape, and so on) to potentially access the same font library.<br>
The font name, for example, must differentiate between a 14-point font<br>
designed for 75 dpi (body size of about 14 pixels) or a 14-point font<br>
designed for 150 dpi (body size of about 28 pixels). Further, in servers that implement
some or all fonts as continuously scaled and<br>
scan-converted outlines, POINT_SIZE and RESOLUTION_Y will help the<br>
server to differentiate between potentially separate font masters for<br>
text, title, and display sizes or for other typographic considerations.<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>3.1.2.10. SPACING Field</p>

<p><br>
<br>
SPACING is a code-string that indicates the escapement class of the<br>
font, that is, monospace (fixed pitch), proportional (variable pitch),<br>
or charcell (a special monospaced font that conforms to the traditional<br>
data-processing character cell font model). The encoding is as follows:<br>
<br>
lw(.5i) lw(1.25i) lw(3.5i). _<br>
Code English Translation Description<br>
_<br>
&quot;P&quot; Proportional T{ A font whose logical character widths vary for<br>
each glyph. Note that no other restrictions are placed on the metrics<br>
of a proportional font. T} &quot;M&quot; Monospaced T{ A font whose logical<br>
character widths are constant (that is, every glyph in the font has the<br>
same logical width). No other restrictions are placed on the metrics of<br>
a monospaced font. T} &quot;C&quot; CharCell T{ A monospaced font that follows<br>
the standard typewriter character cell model (that is, the glyphs of the<br>
font can be modeled by X clients as &quot;boxes&quot; of the same width and height<br>
that are imaged side-by-side to form text strings or top-to-bottom to<br>
form text lines). By definition, all glyphs have the same logical char-<br>
acter width, and no glyphs have &quot;ink&quot; outside of the character cell.<br>
There is no kerning (that is, on a per-character basis with positive<br>
metrics: 0 &lt;= left-bearing &lt;= right-bearing &lt;= width; with negative met-<br>
rics: width &lt;= left-bearing &lt;= right-bearing &lt;= zero). Also, the verti-<br>
cal extents of the font do not exceed the vertical spacing (that is, on<br>
a per-character basis: ascent &lt;= font-ascent and descent &lt;= font-<br>
descent). The cell height = font-descent + font-ascent, and the width =<br>
AVERAGE_WIDTH. T}<br>
_<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>

<h3>3.1.2.11. AVERAGE_WIDTH Field</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AVERAGE_WIDTH is an integer-string typographic metric value that
gives the unweighted arithmetic mean of the absolute value of the width of each glyph in
the font (measured in tenths of pixels), multiplied by -1 if the dominant writing
direction for the font is right-to-left. A leading &quot;~&quot; (TILDE) indicates a
negative value. For monospaced and character cell fonts, this is the width of all glyphs
in the font. Zero is used to indicate a scalable font (see section 5).</p>

<h3>3.1.2.12. CHARSET_REGISTRY and CHARSET_ENCODING Fields</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The character set used to encode the glyphs of the font (and
implicitly the font's glyph repertoire), as maintained by the X Consortium character set
registry. CHARSET_REGISTRY is an x-registered-name that identifies the registration
authority that owns the specified encoding. CHARSET_ENCODING is a registered name that
identifies the coded character set as defined by that registration authority and,
optionally, a subsetting hint.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the X protocol does not explicitly have any knowledge about
character set encodings, it is expected that server implementors will prefer to embed
knowledge of certain proprietary or standard charsets into their font library for reasons
of performance and convenience. The CHARSET_REGISTRY and CHARSET_ENCODING fields or
properties allow an X client font request to specify a specific charset mapping in server
environments where multiple charsets are supported. The availability of any particular
character set is font and server implementation dependent.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To prevent collisions when defining character set names, it is
recommended that CHARSET_REGISTRY and CHARSET_ENCODING name pairs be constructed according
to the following conventions:</p>

<p>CharsetRegistry ::= T{ StdCharsetRegistryName | PrivCharsetRegistryName T} </p>

<p>CharsetEncoding ::= T{ StdCharsetEncodingName | PrivCharsetEncodingName T} </p>

<p>StdCharsetRegistryName ::= T{ StdOrganizationId StdNumber |<br>
StdOrganizationId StdNumber Dot Year T} </p>

<p>PrivCharsetRegistryName ::= OrganizationId STRING8</p>

<p>StdCharsetEncodingName ::= T{ STRING8-numeric part number of referenced standard T} </p>

<p>PrivCharsetEncodingName ::= STRING8 </p>

<p>StdOrganizationId ::= T{ STRING8-the registered<br>
name or acronym of the referenced standard organization T} </p>

<p>StdNumber<br>
::= STRING8-referenced standard number </p>

<p>OrganizationId ::= T{ STRING8-the registered name or acronym of the organization T} </p>

<p>Dot ::= OCTET-&quot;.&quot; (FULL STOP)</p>

<p>Year ::= STRING8-numeric year (for example, 1989)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The X Consortium shall maintain and publish a registry of such
character set names for use in X protocol font names and properties as specified in XLFD.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ISO Latin-1 character set shall be registered by the X
Consortium as the CHARSET_REGISTRY-CHARSET_ENCODING value pair: &quot;ISO8859-1&quot;.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the CHARSET_ENCODING contains a &quot;[&quot; (LEFT SQUARE
BRACKET), the &quot;[&quot; and the characters after it up to a &quot;]&quot; (RIGHT
SQUARE BRACKET) are a subsetting hint telling the font source that the client is
interested only in a subset of the characters of the font. The font source can,
optionally, return a font that contains only those characters or any superset of those
characters. The client can expect to obtain valid glyphs and metrics only for those
characters, and not for any other characters in the font. The font properties may
optionally be calculated by considering only the characters in the subset.</p>

<p>The BNF for the subsetting hint is</p>

<p>Subset ::= LeftBracket RangeList RightBracket </p>

<p>RangeList ::= Range | Range Space RangeList </p>

<p>Range ::= Number | Number Underscore Number </p>

<p>Number ::= &quot;0x&quot; HexNumber | DecNumber </p>

<p>HexNumber ::= HexDigit | HexDigit HexNumber </p>

<p>DecNumber ::= DecDigit | DecDigit DecNumber</p>

<p>DecDigit ::= &quot;0&quot; | &quot;1&quot; | &quot;2&quot; | &quot;3&quot; |
&quot;4&quot; | &quot;5&quot; | &quot;6&quot; | &quot;7&quot; | &quot;8&quot; |
&quot;9&quot;</p>

<p>HexDigit ::= DecDigit | &quot;a&quot; | &quot;b&quot; | &quot;c&quot; | &quot;d&quot; |
&quot;e&quot; | &quot;f&quot;</p>

<p>LeftBracket ::= &quot;[&quot; (LEFT SQUARE BRACKET)</p>

<p>RightBracket ::= &quot;]&quot; (RIGHT SQUARE BRACKET)</p>

<p>Space ::= &quot; &quot; (SPACE)</p>

<p>Underscore ::= &quot;_&quot; (LOW LINE)</p>

<p>Each Range specifies characters that are to be part of the subset<br>
included in the font. A Range containing two Numbers specifies the<br>
first and last character, inclusively, of a range of characters. A<br>
Range that is a single Number specifies a single character to be<br>
included in the font. A HexNumber is interpreted as a hexadecimal num-<br>
ber. A DecNumber is interpreted as a decimal number. The font consists<br>
of the union of all the Ranges in the RangeList.<br>
<br>
For example,</p>

<p><br>
-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--0-0-0-0-c-0-iso8859-1[65 70 80_90]</p>

<p><br>

3.2. Font Properties<br>
<br>
All font properties are optional but will generally include the font<br>
name fields and, on a font-by-font basis, any other useful font descrip-<br>
tive and use information that may be required to use the font intelli-<br>
gently. The XLFD specifies an extensive set of standard X font proper-<br>
ties, their interpretation, and fallback rules when the property is not<br>
defined for a given font. The goal is to provide client applications<br>
with enough font information to be able to make automatic formatting and<br>
display decisions with good typographic results.<br>
<br>
Font property names use the ISO 8859-1 encoding.<br>
<br>
Additional standard X font property definitions may be defined in the<br>
future and private properties may exist in X fonts at any time. Private<br>
font properties should be defined to conform to the general mechanism<br>
defined in the X protocol to prevent overlap of name space and ambiguous<br>
property names, that is, private font property names are of the form:<br>
&quot;_&quot; (LOW LINE), followed by the organizational identifier, followed by<br>
&quot;_&quot; (LOW LINE), and terminated with the property name.<br>
<br>
The Backus-Naur Form syntax description of X font properties is as fol-<br>

unweighted arithmetic mean of the absolute value of the width of each<br>
capital glyph in the font, in tenths of pixels, multiplied by -1 if the<br>
dominant writing direction for the font is right-to-left. This property<br>
applies to both Latin and non-Latin fonts. For Latin fonts, capitals<br>
are the glyphs A through Z. This property is usually used for font<br>
matching or substitution.<br>
<br>
AVG_CAPITAL_WIDTH can be calculated if not provided as a font property,<br>

3.2.21. QUAD_WIDTH<br>
<br>
QUAD_WIDTH is an integer typographic metric (of type INT32) that gives<br>
the width of a quad (em) space. Because all typographic fixed spaces<br>
(em, en, and thin) are constant for a given font size (that is, they do<br>
not vary according to setwidth), the use of this font property has been<br>
deprecated. X clients that require typographic fixed space values are<br>
encouraged to discontinue use of QUAD_WIDTH and compute these values<br>
from other font properties (for example, PIXEL_SIZE). X clients that<br>
require a font-dependent width value should use either the FIGURE_WIDTH<br>

FIGURE_WIDTH is an integer typographic metric (of type INT32) that gives<br>
the width of the tabular figures and the dollar sign, if suitable for<br>
tabular setting (all widths equal). For Latin fonts, these tabular fig-<br>
ures are the Arabic numerals 0 through 9.<br>

For polymorphic fonts, RELATIVE_SETWIDTH is not necessarily a linear<br>
function of the font's setwidth axis.<br>
<br>
X clients that want to obtain a calculated proportionate width of the<br>
font (that is, a font-independent way of identifying the proportionate<br>
width across all fonts and all font vendors) can use the following algo-<br>

tion of the font's weight axis.<br>
<br>
3.2.39. WEIGHT<br>
<br>
Calculated WEIGHT is an unsigned integer value (of type CARD32) that<br>
gives the calculated weight of the font, computed as the ratio of capi-<br>
tal stem width to CAP_HEIGHT, in the range 0 to 1000, where 0 is the<br>
lightest weight.<br>
<br>
WEIGHT can be calculated if not supplied as a font property, according<br>
to the following algorithm:<br>
<br>
<br>
CapStemWidth = average width of the stems of capitals<br>
if (WEIGHT undefined) then<br>
WEIGHT = ROUND ((CapStemWidth * 1000) / CAP_HEIGHT)<br>
<br>
<br>
A calculated value for weight is necessary when matching fonts from dif-<br>
ferent families because both the RELATIVE_WEIGHT and the WEIGHT_NAME are<br>
assigned by the typeface supplier, according to its tradition and prac-<br>
tice, and therefore, are somewhat subjective. Calculated WEIGHT pro-<br>
vides a font-independent way of identifying the weight across all fonts<br>
and all font vendors.<br>

RESOLUTION is an integer value (of type INT32) that gives the resolution<br>
for which this font was created, measured in 1/100 pixels per point. As<br>
independent horizontal and vertical design resolution components are<br>
required to accommodate displays with nonsquare aspect ratios, the use<br>
of this font property has been deprecated, and independent RESOLUTION_X<br>

proofing font to match printer font glyph widths (WYSIWYG), as an opti-<br>
mal video font (possibly with corresponding printer font) for extended<br>
screen viewing (video text), and so on.<br>
<br>
The font design considerations are very different, and at current dis-<br>
play resolutions, the readability and legibility of these two kinds of<br>
screen fonts are very different. DESTINATION allows publishing clients<br>

4. Matrix Transformations<br>
<br>
An XLFD name presented to the server can have the POINT_SIZE or<br>
PIXEL_SIZE field begin with the character &quot;[&quot;. If the first character<br>
of the field is &quot;[&quot;, the character must be followed with ASCII represen-<br>
tations of four floating point numbers and a trailing &quot;]&quot;, with white<br>
space separating the numbers and optional white space separating the<br>
numbers from the &quot;[&quot; and &quot;]&quot; characters. Numbers use standard floating<br>
point syntax but use the character &quot;~&quot; to represent a minus sign in the<br>
mantissa or exponent.<br>
<br>
The BNF for a matrix transformation string is as follows:<br>
<br>
rw(1.5i) l. MatrixString ::= T{ LeftBracket OptionalSpace Float<br>
Space Float Space Float Space Float OptionalSpace RightBracket T}<br>
OptionalSpace ::= &quot;&quot; | Space Space ::= SpaceChar | SpaceChar Space<br>

&quot; &quot; (SPACE) Tilde ::= OCTET - &quot;~&quot; (TILDE) Plus ::= OCTET -
&quot;+&quot; (PLUS)<br>
Dot ::= OCTET - &quot;.&quot; (FULL STOP)<br>
<br>
<br>
The string &quot;[a b c d]&quot; represents a graphical transformation of the<br>
glyphs in the font by the matrix<br>
<br>
c c c c c. [ a b 0 ] [ c d 0 ]<br>
[ 0 0 1 ]<br>
<br>
<br>
All transformations occur around the origin of the glyph. The relation-<br>
ship between the current scalar values and the matrix transformation<br>
values is that the scalar value &quot;N&quot; in the POINT_SIZE field produces the<br>
same glyphs as the matrix &quot;[N/10 0 0 N/10]&quot; in that field, and the<br>
scalar value &quot;N&quot; in the PIXEL_SIZE field produces the same glyphs as the<br>
matrix &quot;[N*RESOLUTION_X/RESOLUTION_Y 0 0 N]&quot; in that field.<br>
<br>
If matrices are specified for both the POINT_SIZE and PIXEL_SIZE, they<br>
must bear the following relationship to each other within an implementa-<br>
tion-specific tolerance:<br>
PIXEL_SIZE_MATRIX = [Sx 0 0 Sy] * POINT_SIZE_MATRIX<br>
where<br>
Sx = RESOLUTION_X / 72.27<br>
Sy = RESOLUTION_Y / 72.27<br>
<br>
If either the POINT_SIZE or PIXEL_SIZE field is unspecified (either &quot;0&quot;<br>
or wildcarded), the preceding formulas can be used to compute one from<br>
the other.<br>

4.1. Metrics and Font Properties<br>
<br>
In this section, the phrase &quot;1000 pixel metrics&quot; means the metrics that<br>
would be obtained if the rasterizer took the base untransformed design<br>
used to generate the transformed font and scaled it linearly to a height<br>
of 1000 pixels, with no rotation component. Note that there may be no<br>
way for the application to actually request this font since the raster-<br>
izer may use different outlines or rasterization techniques at that size<br>
from the ones used to generate the transformed font.<br>
<br>
Notes on properties and metrics:<br>
<br>
The per-char ink metrics (lbearing, rbearing, ascent, and descent) rep-<br>
resent the ink extent of the transformed glyph around its origin.<br>
<br>
The per-char width is the x component of the transformed character<br>
width.<br>
<br>
The font ascent and descent are the y component of the transformed font<br>
ascent or descent.<br>
<br>
The FONT property returns a name reflecting the matrix being used--that<br>
is, the name returned can be used to open another instance of the same<br>
font. The returned name is not necessarily an exact copy of the<br>
requested name. If, for example, the user requests<br>
-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--0-[2e1 0 0.0 +10.0]-72-72-c-0-iso8859-1<br>
the resulting FONT property might be<br>
-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--[19.9 0 0 10]-[20 0 0<br>
10]-72-72-c-0-iso8859-1<br>
The FONT property will always include matrices in both the PIXEL_SIZE<br>
and the POINT_SIZE fields.<br>
<br>
To allow accurate client positioning of transformed characters, the<br>
attributes field of the XCharInfo contains the width of the character in<br>
1000 pixel metrics. This attributes field should be interpreted as a<br>
signed integer.<br>
<br>
There will always be 2 new font properties defined, RAW_ASCENT and<br>
RAW_DESCENT, that hold the ascent and descent in 1000 pixel metrics.<br>
<br>
All font properties that represent horizontal widths or displacements<br>
have as their value the x component of the transformed width or dis-<br>
placement. All font properties that represent vertical heights or dis-<br>
placements have as their value the y component of the transformed height<br>
or displacement. Each such property will be accompanied by a new prop-<br>
erty, named as the original except prefixed with &quot;RAW_&quot;, that gives the<br>
value of the width, height, or displacement in 1000 pixel metrics.<br>
<br>
5. Scalable Fonts<br>
<br>
The XLFD is designed to support scalable fonts. A scalable font is a<br>
font source from which instances of arbitrary size can be derived. A<br>
scalable font source might be one or more outlines together with zero or<br>
more hand-tuned bitmap fonts at specific sizes and resolutions, or it<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
30<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
X Logical Font Description Conventions X11, Release 6.3<br>
<br>
<br>
might be a programmatic description together with zero or more bitmap<br>
fonts, or some other format (perhaps even just a single bitmap font).<br>
<br>
The following definitions are useful for discussing scalable fonts:<br>
<br>
Well-formed XLFD pattern<br>
<br>
A pattern string containing 14 hyphens, one of which is the first<br>
character of the pattern. Wildcard characters are permitted in the<br>
fields of a well-formed XLFD pattern.<br>
<br>
Scalable font name<br>
<br>
A well-formed XLFD pattern containing no wildcards and containing<br>
the digit &quot;0&quot; in the PIXEL_SIZE, POINT_SIZE, and AVERAGE_WIDTH<br>
fields.<br>
<br>
Scalable fields<br>
<br>
The XLFD fields PIXEL_SIZE, POINT_SIZE, RESOLUTION_X, RESOLUTION_Y,<br>
and AVERAGE_WIDTH.<br>
<br>
Derived instance<br>
<br>
The result of replacing the scalable fields of a font name with<br>
values to yield a font name that could actually be produced from<br>
the font source. A scaling engine is permitted, but not required,<br>
to interpret the scalable fields in font names to support anamor-<br>
phic scaling.<br>
<br>
Global list<br>
<br>
The list of names that would be returned by an X server for a pro-<br>
tocol request on the pattern &quot;*&quot; if there were no protocol restric-<br>
tions on the total number of names returned.<br>
<br>
<br>
The global list consists of font names derived from font sources. If a<br>
single font source can support multiple character sets (specified in the<br>
CHARSET_REGISTRY and CHARSET_ENCODING fields), each such character set<br>
should be used to form a separate font name in the list. For a nonscal-<br>
able font source, the simple font name for each character set is<br>
included in the global list. For a scalable font source, a scalable<br>
font name for each character set is included in the list. In addition<br>
to the scalable font name, specific derived instance names may also be<br>
included in the list. The relative order of derived instances with<br>
respect to the scalable font name is not constrained. Finally, font<br>
name aliases may also be included in the list. The relative order of<br>
aliases with respect to the real font name is not constrained.<br>
<br>
The values of the RESOLUTION_X and RESOLUTION_Y fields of a scalable<br>
font name are implementation dependent, but to maximize backward compat-<br>
ibility, they should be reasonable nonzero values, for example, a reso-<br>
lution close to that provided by the screen (in a single-screen server).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
31<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
X Logical Font Description Conventions X11, Release 6.3<br>
<br>
<br>
Because some existing applications rely on seeing a collection of point<br>
and pixel sizes, server vendors are strongly encouraged in the near term<br>
to provide a mechanism for including, for each scalable font name, a set<br>
of specific derived instance names. For font sources that contain a<br>
collection of hand-tuned bitmap fonts, including names of these<br>
instances in the global list is recommended and sufficient.<br>
<br>
The X protocol request on a scalable font name returns a font corre-<br>
sponding to an implementation-dependent derived instance of that font<br>
name.<br>
<br>
The X protocol request on a well-formed XLFD pattern returns the follow-<br>
ing. Starting with the global list, if the actual pattern argument has<br>
values containing no wildcards in scalable fields, then substitute each<br>
such field into the corresponding field in each scalable font name in<br>
the list. For each resulting font name, if the remaining scalable<br>
fields cannot be replaced with values to produce a derived instance,<br>
remove the font name from the list. Now take the modified list, and<br>
perform a simple pattern match against the pattern argument. returns<br>
the resulting list.<br>
<br>
For example, given the global list:<br>
<br>
-Linotype-Times-Bold-I-Normal--0-0-100-100-P-0-ISO8859-1<br>
-Linotype-Times-Bold-R-Normal--0-0-100-100-P-0-ISO8859-1<br>
-Linotype-Times-Medium-I-Normal--0-0-100-100-P-0-ISO8859-1<br>
-Linotype-Times-Medium-R-Normal--0-0-100-100-P-0-ISO8859-1<br>
<br>
<br>
a request with the pattern:<br>
<br>
<br>
-*-Times-*-R-Normal--*-120-100-100-P-*-ISO8859-1<br>
<br>
<br>
would return:<br>
<br>
-Linotype-Times-Bold-R-Normal--0-120-100-100-P-0-ISO8859-1<br>
-Linotype-Times-Medium-R-Normal--0-120-100-100-P-0-ISO8859-1<br>
<br>
<br>
on a pattern containing wildcards that is not a well-formed XLFD pattern<br>
is only required to return the list obtained by performing a simple pat-<br>
tern match against the global list. X servers are permitted, but not<br>
required, to use a more sophisticated matching algorithm.<br>
<br>
6. Polymorphic Fonts<br>
<br>
Fonts that can be varied in ways other than size or resolution are<br>
called polymorphic fonts. Multiple Master Type 1 font programs are one<br>
type of a polymorphic font. Current examples of axes along which the<br>
fonts can be varied are width, weight, and optical size; others might<br>
include formality or x-height.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
32<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
X Logical Font Description Conventions X11, Release 6.3<br>
<br>
<br>
To support polymorphic fonts, special values indicating variability are<br>
defined for the following XLFD fields:<br>
WEIGHT_NAME<br>
SLANT<br>
SETWIDTH_NAME<br>
ADD_STYLE_NAME<br>
<br>
The string &quot;0&quot; is the special polymorphic value. In the WEIGHT_NAME,<br>
SLANT, or SETWIDTH_NAME field, &quot;0&quot; must be the entire field. There may<br>
be multiple polymorphic values in the ADD_STYLE_NAME field. They are<br>
surrounded by &quot;[&quot; and &quot;]&quot; and separated by a Space, as &quot;[0
0]&quot;. The<br>
polymorphic values may coexist with other data in the field. It is rec-<br>
ommended that the polymorphic values be at the end of the ADD_STYLE_NAME<br>
field.<br>
<br>
The font-matching algorithms for a font with polymorphic fields are<br>
identical to the matching algorithms for a font with scalable fields.<br>
<br>
There are three new font properties to describe the axes of variation,<br>
AXIS_NAMES, AXIS_LIMITS, and AXIS_TYPES. AXIS_NAMES is a list of all<br>
the names of the axes for the font, separated by a null (0) byte. These<br>
names are suitable for presentation in a user interface. AXIS_LIMITS is<br>
a list of integers, two for each axis, giving the minimum and maximum<br>
allowable values for that axis. AXIS_TYPES is like AXIS_NAMES, but can<br>
be registered as having specific semantics.<br>
<br>
The axes are listed in the properties in the same order as they appear<br>
in the font name. They are matched with font name fields by looking for<br>
the special polymorphic values in the font name.<br>
<br>
Examples:<br>
<br>
The Adobe Myriad MM font program has width and weight axes. Weight can<br>
vary from 215 to 830, and width from 300 to 700.<br>
<br>
Name:<br>
-Adobe-Myriad MM-0-R-0--0-0-0-0-P-0-ISO8859-1<br>
AXIS_NAMES:<br>
Weight, Width<br>
AXIS_LIMITS:<br>
215, 830, 300, 700<br>
AXIS_TYPES:<br>
Adobe-Weight, Adobe-Width<br>
Sample derived instance:<br>
-Adobe-Myriad MM-412-R-575--*-120-100-100-P-*-ISO8859-1<br>
<br>
<br>
The Adobe Minion MM Italic font program has width, weight, and optical<br>
size axes.<br>
<br>
Name:<br>
-Adobe-Minion MM-0-I-0-[0]-0-0-0-0-P-0-ISO8859-1<br>
AXIS_NAMES:<br>
Weight, Width, Optical size<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
X Logical Font Description Conventions X11, Release 6.3<br>
<br>
<br>
AXIS_LIMITS:<br>
345, 620, 450, 600, 6, 72<br>
AXIS_TYPES:<br>
Adobe-Weight, Adobe-Width, Adobe-OpticalSize<br>
Sample derived instance:<br>
-Adobe-Minion MM-550-I-480-[18]-*-180-100-100-P-*-ISO8859-1<br>
<br>
<br>
The Adobe Minion MM Swash Italic font program has the same axes and val-<br>
ues. This shows how &quot;[0]&quot; in the ADD_STYLE_NAME field can coexist with<br>
other words.<br>
<br>
Name:<br>
-Adobe-Minion MM-0-I-0-Swash[0]-0-0-0-0-P-0-ISO8859-1<br>
AXIS_NAMES:<br>
Weight, Width, Optical size<br>
AXIS_LIMITS:<br>
345, 620, 450, 600, 6, 72<br>
AXIS_TYPES:<br>
Adobe-Weight, Adobe-Width, Adobe-OpticalSize<br>
Sample derived instance:<br>
-Adobe-Minion MM-550-I-480-Swash[18]-*-180-100-100-P-*-ISO8859-1<br>
<br>
<br>
The XYZ Abc font, a hypothetical font, has optical size and x-height<br>
axes. This shows how there can be more than one polymorphic value in<br>
the ADD_STYLE_NAME field.<br>
<br>
Name:<br>
-XYZ-Abc-Medium-R-Normal-[0 0]-0-0-0-0-P-0-ISO8859-1<br>
AXIS_NAMES:<br>
Optical size, X-height<br>
AXIS_LIMITS:<br>
6, 72, 400, 600<br>
AXIS_TYPES:<br>
XYZ-OpticalSize, XYZ-Xheight<br>
Sample derived instance:<br>
-XYZ-Abc-Medium-R-Normal-[14 510]-*-140-100-100-P-*-ISO8859-1<br>
<br>
<br>
If an axis allows negative values, a client requests a negative value by<br>
using &quot;~&quot; (TILDE) as a minus sign.<br>
<br>
Axis types can be registered with the X Consortium, along with their<br>
semantics.<br>
<br>
If a font name that contains the polymorphic value or a wildcard in a<br>
polymorphic field is presented to a font source, the font source is free<br>
to substitute any value that is convenient. However, font sources<br>
should try to use a value that would be considered normal or medium for<br>
the particular font. For example, if an optical size variable is unre-<br>
solved, the font source should provide a value appropriate to the size<br>
of the font.</p>

<p>The result of specifying an out-of-range value for a polymorphic field<br>
is undefined. The font source may treat this as a BadName error, treat<br>
the value as if it were the closest legal value, or extrapolate to try<br>
to accommodate the value.<br>
<br>
</p>

<h3>8. BDF Conformance</h3>

<p>The bitmap font distribution and interchange format adopted by the X Consortium (BDF
V2.1) provides a general mechanism for identifying the font name of an X font and a
variable list of font properties, but it does not mandate the syntax or semantics of the
font name or the semantics of the font properties that might be provided in a BDF font.
This section identifies the requirements for BDF fonts that conform to XLFD.</p>

<h3>8.1. XLFD Conformance Requirements</h3>

<p>A BDF font conforms to the XLFD specification if and only if the following conditions
are satisfied:

<ul>
  <li>The value for the BDF item FONT conforms to the syntax and semantic definition of a XLFD
    string.</li>
  <li>The begins with the X prefix: &quot;-&quot;.</li>
  <li>All XLFD fields are defined.</li>
  <li>Any FontProperties provided conform in name and semantics to the XLFD definitions.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A simple method of testing for conformance would entail verifying
that the prefix is the string &quot;-&quot;, that the number of field delimiters in the
string and coded field values are valid, and that each font property name either matches a
standard XLFD property name or follows the definition of a private property.</p>

<h3>8.2. FONT_ASCENT, FONT_DESCENT, and DEFAULT_CHAR</h3>

<p>FONT_ASCENT, FONT_DESCENT, and DEFAULT_CHAR are provided in the BDF<br>
specification as properties that are moved to the by the BDF font com-<br>
piler in generating the X server-specific binary font encoding. If pre-<br>
sent, these properties shall comply with the following semantic defini-<br>
tions.</p>

<p>8.2.1. FONT_ASCENT<br>
<br>
FONT_ASCENT is an integer value (of type INT32) that gives the recom-<br>
mended typographic ascent above the baseline for determining interline<br>
spacing. Specific glyphs of the font may extend beyond this. If the<br>
current position point for line n is at [X,Y], then the origin of the<br>
next line m = n + 1 (allowing for a possible font change) is [X, Y +<br>
FONT_DESCENTn + FONT_ASCENTm].<br>
<br>
FONT_ASCENT can be approximated if not provided as a font property,<br>
according to the following algorithm:<br>
<br>
<br>
if (FONT_ASCENT undefined) then<br>
FONT_ASCENT = maximum ascent<br>
<br>
where maximum ascent is the maximum ascent (above the baseline) in pix-<br>
els of any glyph in the font.</p>

<p>8.2.2. FONT_DESCENT<br>
<br>
FONT_DESCENT is an integer value (of type INT32) that gives the recom-<br>
mended typographic descent below the baseline for determining interline<br>
spacing. Specific glyphs of the font may extend beyond this. If the<br>
current position point for line n is at [X,Y], then the origin of the<br>
next line m = n+1 (allowing for a possible font change) is [X, Y +<br>
FONT_DESCENTn + FONT_ASCENTm].<br>
<br>
The logical extent of the font is inclusive between the Y-coordinate<br>
values: Y - FONT_ASCENT and Y + FONT_DESCENT + 1.<br>
<br>
FONT_DESCENT can be approximated if not provided as a font property,<br>
according to the following algorithm:<br>
<br>
<br>
if (FONT_DESCENT undefined) then<br>
FONT_DESCENT = maximum descent<br>
<br>
where maximum descent is the maximum descent (below the baseline) in<br>
pixels of any glyph in the font.</p>

<h3>8.2.3. DEFAULT_CHAR</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The DEFAULT_CHAR is an unsigned integer value (of type CARD32) that
specifies the index of the default character to be used by the X server when an attempt is
made to display an undefined or nonexistent character in the font. (For a font using a
2-byte matrix format, the index bytes are encoded in the integer as byte1 * 65536 +
byte2.) If the DEFAULT_CHAR itself specifies an undefined or nonexistent character in the
font, then no display is performed.</p>

<p>DEFAULT_CHAR cannot be approximated if not provided as a font property.</p>
