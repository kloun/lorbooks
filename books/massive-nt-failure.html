Subject: Risk: Massive NT Outage due to Registry corruption

  [This was sent me by someone at a Fortune-100 manufacturer, and is
  anonymized and sanitized at the original sender's request.  It is genuine.]

&gt; The recent power fluctuations here in [placename] corrupted the NT
&gt; registries in our [server-community-names].  As a result, our entire NT
&gt; network (&gt;10K machines) is down, and has been since 5 am this
&gt; morning. (I'm doing direct IP to [product-name] to do mail. Thank God.)
&gt; Once the registries got corrupted, the databases of user signons went,
&gt; too. And, of course, the tape backups won't load because NT requires a
&gt; timestamp somewhere in the guts that the tape image doesn't match to the
&gt; clock. So every NT server, and most NT workstations, won't do anything
&gt; except local work.

&gt; If this were just office workers, it would be annoying enough. But the
&gt; [product name] servers require such close tie-ins to the machine accounts
&gt; that they are dead -- guess what helps run our factories? Can you say loss
&gt; of $1M+ per hour?"

&gt; Why am I telling you? Because our NT guys have suddenly realized that this
&gt; is a good candidate for a denial of service attack: once the registries
&gt; get corrupted, the entire resource domain has to be reloaded by hand --
&gt; and that apparently includes desktops. If you have ideas on how to go
&gt; check the registries on your NT servers, I'd suggest you go do so.

In another letter, the original sender elaborates:

&gt; If you are recovering from this, every desktop user will have to
&gt; delete/disable their &lt;user&gt;.pwl file to be able to get back on the
&gt; network, because that file hardcodes which domain server they are
&gt; on. HOWEVER, if they do that, they can then not get into any other service
&gt; on their desktop for which they've stored the password, because they're
&gt; all in that file. if the user doesn't remember the password, they're SOL,
&gt; because the latest patch from MS keeps the *.pwl files from being hackable
&gt; by the "standard" hacker and pwledit tools -- but it is also rendered
&gt; unreadable to the MS standard pwl editor, too.

The total outage was in excess of 12 hours, and the loss-of-revenue from
the outage is estimated to be more than $10 million.
