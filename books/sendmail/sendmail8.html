<a name="toc8"></a><P><B>8. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</B></P>

<P>I've worked on <U>sendmail</U> for many years, and many employers
have been remarkably patient about letting me work on a large project that
was not part of my official job. This includes time on the INGRES Project
at the University of California at Berkeley, at Britton Lee, and again
on the Mammoth and Titan Projects at Berkeley.</P>

<P>Much of the second wave of improvements should be credited to Bryan
Costales of ICSI. As he passed me drafts of his book on <U>sendmail</U>
I was inspired to start working on things again. Bryan was also available
to bounce ideas off of.</P>

<P>Many, many people contributed chunks of code and ideas to <U>sendmail</U>.
It has proven to be a group network effort. Version 8 in particular was
a group project. The following people made notable contributions:</P>
<dir>
<P>John Beck, Hewlett-Packard</P>

<P>Keith Bostic, CSRG, University of California, Berkeley Andrew Cheng,
Sun Microsystems</P>

<P>Michael J. Corrigan, University of California, San Diego Bryan Costales,
International Computer Science Institute Par (Pell) Emanuelsson</P>

<P>Craig Everhart, Transarc Corporation</P>

<P>Tom Ivar Helbekkmo, Norwegian School of Economics</P>

<P>Allan E. Johannesen, WPI</P>

<P>Takahiro Kanbe, Fuji Xerox Information Systems Co., Ltd. Brian Kantor,
University of California, San Diego</P>

<P>Motonori Nakamura, Ritsumeikan University &amp; Kyoto University
John Gardiner Myers, Carnegie Mellon University</P>

<P>Neil Rickert, Northern Illinois University</P>

</dir>
<P>I apologize for anyone I have omitted, misspelled, misattributed,
or otherwise missed. At this point, I suspect</P>

<P>that at least a hundred people have contributed code, and many more
have contributed ideas, comments, and encouragement. I've tried to list
them in the RELEASE_NOTES in the distribution directory. I appreciate their
contribution as well.</P>

<P>Special thanks are reserved for Michael Corrigan and Christophe Wolfhugel,
who besides being wonderful guinea pigs and contributors have also consented
to be added to the &quot;sendmail@Sendmail.ORG&quot; list and, by answering
the bulk of the questions sent to that list, have freed me up to do other
work.</P>
